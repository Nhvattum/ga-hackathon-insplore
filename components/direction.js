                Have these crazy Covid times made it too difficult to get out to explore the world around you?
                Welcome to Insplore, an app that allows you to travel the world virtually. 
                Click on "Randomize" and you will be transported to random location. Once there, Insplore will provide
                you with an overhead map of the area as well as several points of interest to help launch your exporation.
                If getting dropped off at a random location isn't for you, click on our "Destinations" button and Insplore
                can give you a list of possible places for you to select where you would like to visit.
